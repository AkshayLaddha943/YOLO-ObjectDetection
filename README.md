# YOLO-ObjectDetection

## YOLOv3
YOLO v3 uses a more complex network architecture and incorporates skip connections, which improves the accuracy of the predictions - 

• Multi-scale predictions: YOLO v3 uses anchor boxes of different sizes to detect objects at different scales, which improves the accuracy of the predictions

• Improved non-maximum suppression: YOLO v3 uses a more sophisticated non-maximum suppression algorithm, which helps to eliminate duplicate detections

• Improved training: YOLO v3 uses a technique called label smoothing to improve the generalization of the network and reduce overfitting
